I'm Marco Pereira, an Oracle ACE and Software Architect at Viscosity North America. With over a decade of experience building enterprise apps using Oracle APEX, SQL, PL/SQL and modern web technologies, I specialize in designing scalable solutions that create real business impact.

My professional journey began in Guatemala, leading me to Houston, Texas, where I drive strategic APEX initiatives. I'm passionate about knowledge sharing and innovation, teaching university courses on Integrated Cloud Solutions, Advanced Programming and Expert Systems in AI.

I hold a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence from Universidad de La Rioja and an MBA from Universidad San Pablo de Guatemala, bringing a blend of technical depth and business insight to every project.
